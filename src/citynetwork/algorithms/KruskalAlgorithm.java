/**
 * Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree.
 * 
 * Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds the MST by sorting all
 * edges by weight and repeatedly adding the minimum weight edge that doesn't
 * create a cycle. Uses Union-Find data structure for efficient cycle detection.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(E log E) dominated by edge sorting
 * Space Complexity: O(V + E) for edge list and Union-Find structure
 * 
 * Best suited for sparse graphs where E â‰ˆ V
